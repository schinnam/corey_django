manage.py --> supports django-admin commands and running server.
__init__.py --> just to say this is a python project. This file is not required when creating pip package.
settings.py --> settings for the app
urls.py --> here we decide the routes and the corresponding code to run
wsgi.py --> wsgi decides how our python web application and web server communicate

* Now we already have everything needed to run a basic django project. 
python manage.py runserver

http://127.0.0.1:8000/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
This admin page is being handled by route mentioned in urls.py 

* with debug=true in settings, our changes should automatically reflect in the page without reloading the server.
